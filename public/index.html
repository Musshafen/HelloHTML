      At the heart of Rochester's culinary scene, the Garbage Plate reigns
      supreme. This iconic dish, born in the late-night diners of the city, is a
      magnificent medley of flavors and textures that reflects the diverse
      cultural influences present in Rochester. A Garbage Plate typically
      consists of a base of piping-hot home fries and macaroni salad, topped
      with a choice of meat, such as juicy burgers or succulent hot dogs. This
      tantalizing foundation is then crowned with a blanket of ketchup, zesty
      mustard, tangy onions, and a ladle of hearty meat hot sauce. Each bite
      brings a symphony of savory, salty, and tangy sensations, making it a
      truly unforgettable dining experience.
